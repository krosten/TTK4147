# TTK4147 - Real-time Systems  

## Exercise - Time

In the first exercises you will be introduced to some concepts that are
important for C programming and necessary for this course, even if it is not
directly related to real time. This exercise focuses on the behavior of
different methods for waiting and measuring time. Only parts of the information
you need in the exercises is given in the exercise text. You may need to
find information on the internet and from other sources, or ask the student
assistants, they are there to help you.

Before you start, you should connect and log in on your RPI.

## Measuring time

There are different methods that you can use to measure time, depending on what
you want to measure and how accurate you need the measurements to be. The first
kind of time measurements are ones that return wall time, which sounds like a
wonderfully practical thing that returns "real time", but the clock on the
computer could be wrong due to adjustments made by the OS, changes in daylight
savings time or even leap seconds. The result is that these kinds of functions
can report unexpected discontinuities in time.

For real-time applications, we are generally interested in periods and
durations, so we instead prefer using monotonic clocks, which are clocks that
will always count upward at a constant rate. The absolute value of these clocks
doesn’t mean much, and is usually just the number of ticks since the system boot
time.

If you want to measure the time it takes to execute a program, you can use a
small program called `time`, as follows:

    time ./your_program

If you want to measure time within your program, you can use one of these
methods:

- `clock_gettime()`, which has capabilities for both REALTIME (which is actually
  wall time) and MONOTONIC, as well as some others.

- `times()`, which reports the user and system time spent executing this program
  in hundredths of seconds. Alternatively `getrusage()`, which also reports the
  resource usage for many other things.

- `rdtsc()` which reads the CPU counter register directly. You can check the
  frequency with `$ sudo dmesg | grep MHz`.

Here are some useful functions for manipulating `struct timespec`, used by
`clock_gettime()`:

```c
struct timespec timespec_normalized(time_t sec, long nsec){
    while(nsec >= 1000000000){
        nsec -= 1000000000;
        ++sec;
    }
    while(nsec < 0){
        nsec += 1000000000;
        --sec;
    }
    return (struct timespec){sec, nsec};
}

struct timespec timespec_sub(struct timespec lhs, struct timespec rhs){
    return timespec_normalized(lhs.tv_sec - rhs.tv_sec, lhs.tv_nsec - rhs.tv_nsec);
}

struct timespec timespec_add(struct timespec lhs, struct timespec rhs){
    return timespec_normalized(lhs.tv_sec + rhs.tv_sec, lhs.tv_nsec + rhs.tv_nsec);
}

int timespec_cmp(struct timespec lhs, struct timespec rhs){
    if (lhs.tv_sec < rhs.tv_sec)
        return -1;
    if (lhs.tv_sec > rhs.tv_sec)
        return 1;
    return lhs.tv_nsec - rhs.tv_nsec;
}
```

## Waiting

If we want our code to wait for a given amount of time we use a sleep function,
some examples are: `sleep()`, `usleep()` or `nanosleep()`. While one thread is
sleeping, others can run. Another method for delaying the execution is to use
busy-wait delays, which means that the thread will execute a function that takes
a known amount of time. Below is a sample code for a busy-wait delay function:

```c
void busy_wait(struct timespec t){
    struct timespec now;
    clock_gettime(CLOCK_MONOTONIC, &now);
    struct timespec then = timespec_add(now, t);
    
    while(timespec_cmp(now, then) < 0){
        for(int i = 0; i < 10000; i++){}
        clock_gettime(CLOCK_MONOTONIC, &now);
    }
}
```

Several of these functions are not technically part of the C standard library,
but rather the GNU extended standard library. Remember to set the compiler flag
–std=gnu11.

#### TASK A

Write a simple program that just waits for one second before terminating. Use
the command‑line program time to compare the real, user, and system time passed
when waiting by using

- `sleep()`, `usleep()` or `nanosleep()`

- `busy_wait()` with `clock_gettime(CLOCK_MONOTONIC,...)` (provided above)

- `busy_wait()` with `times()` (which you will have to make yourself)

Which one uses the most system time, and why?

Hint: do all waiting methods operate strictly in user space?

#### TASK B

Estimate and compare the **access latency** (the time it takes to get a value
from a timer) and the **resolution** (the shortest measurable time interval) for
these three timers:

- `rdtsc()`

- `clock_gettime()`

- `times()`

The `rdtsc()` timer for Arm64 can be implemented by reading the virtual count
register on the processor, as shown below:

```c
uint64_t rdtsc(void){
    uint64_t val;
    asm volatile("isb; mrs %0, cntvct_el0; isb; " : "=r"(val) :: "memory"); 
    // You can check the current CPU frequency with $sudo dmesg | grep MHz
    return val;
}
```

You can estimate the access latency by reading the timer n times in a for loop,
then dividing the time taken (measured with time) by n:

```c
for(int i = 0; i < 10*1000*1000; i++){
    // read timer
}
```

You can estimate the resolution of a timer by finding the typical (or shortest)
time difference between two successive calls to the timer. Remember to convert
the time difference into nanoseconds. Create a histogram with `gnuplot` by using
the sample code below:

```c
int ns_max = 50;
int histogram[ns_max];
memset(histogram, 0, sizeof(int)*ns_max);

for(int i = 0; i < 10*1000*1000; i++){
    
    // t1 = timer()
    // t2 = timer()
    
    int ns = // (t2 - t1) * ??
    
    if(ns >= 0 && ns < ns_max){
        histogram[ns]++;
    }
}

for(int i = 0; i < ns_max; i++){
    printf("%d\n", histogram[i]);
}
```

Pipe the output from the program into `gnuplot` like this:

```shell
./program_name | gnuplot -e "set terminal pngcairo size 1280, 720;set output 'plot.png';set title 'My Plot';plot '<cat' with boxes"
```

If gnuplot is not installed or you get an error regarding gnuplot, use the
following command to install the correct version:

```shell
    sudo apt install gnuplot
```
The created png can be copied over to the lab-pc and viewed there. 

Hint: `times()` might seem like it has infinite resolution, but this is not
true. Have a look at the documentation to find out why.

#### TASK C

Measure the time it takes to context-switch to the kernel and back, by inserting
a call to `sched_yield()` (found in `sched.h`) between the two successive calls
to the timer. You only have to do this for a single timer (`clock_gettime()`),
and you will have to increase `ns_max`.
